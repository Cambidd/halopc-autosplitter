# Halo: CE Autosplitter
This is a livesplit autosplitter for Halo: CE.
This project targets the gearbox 2003 retail release as well as custom editon (2004).

## Usage
The autosplitter is built into livesplit.
To enable, in the "Edit Splits" window, enter "Halo: Combat Evolved" under Game Name.
You should see "Autosplitting for Halo: CE (2003 PC version, by Cambid)".
Activate the autosplitter if it is deactivated by clicking "Activate".

## Settings
The autosplitter functionality can be customised under Settings in "Edit Splits"
By default the autosplitter is set up for full game runs. Only "Split on loading screen"
should be selected under Advanced. To swtich to timing invdividual levels, select
